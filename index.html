    I am Pol de la Torre Solé, student of the <a href="https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/">Bachelor’s Degree in 
    Video Games by UPC at CITM</a>. This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer

    <h2>
      What is a Technical Design document?
    </h2>
    
    <p>The Technical Design document is the blueprint that all the engineers on the team will need to understand and use on the process of the creation of a game, the TDD needs to explain not only what will be created it also explains how it will be implemented.</p>
    
    <p>There is a common misunderstanding of what is an TDD, in game development it also exist the GDD (game design document) the definition of both look similar, but the crucial difference is that the TDD it specifies more technically the different parts of the creation of the game and the GDD only describes the game itself and not how it is done. There is also another TDD (test driven development) but this one has nothing to do with the Technical design document.</p>

   <h3>Purpose of the technical design document:</h3>
    <p>Besides the developers of the team the TDD will also be used to explain the game to any publishers our vision and use it as an early milestone to the publisher, the problem that appears with this is that the developers are pressured on the early stages and there is not much time to think the TDD, because the publisher normally prefer seeing something working on the screen, in the stage of the TDD creation is really important because detecting a defect on an early stage like this will save lots of time, energy and money to the team, so the more time expended making a good TDD the less problems we will be facing in the future.</p>

    <h2>
     Which is the moment to make the TDD?
    </h2>
    <p>Normally the TDD needs to be created on the preproduction stage alongside with the document design , during the stage of production there are times when it is necessary to change the TDD , there is nothing wrong on adapting de TDD in response to any change in the game.</p>

    <h2>
     What really goes inside a TDD? 
    </h2>
    <p>The TDD we actually can see it as shopping list of the requirements of the game, which we define whom, when and how this conditions will be achieved, we can see the TDD as a miniature of the project with several stages, in this stages there will be many diagrams and time estimates to complete the different tasks.</p>
    <h3>Requirements Capture:</h3>
    <p>Requirements capture is the part when we identify all the requirements the game has to satisfy, in this process everyone in the team takes part writing down their expectations, and it can be anything from going to 60 fps to having 3d sound and much more like this, but this stage will be the most critical to a successful project and is also the most difficult. It is difficult to know when you have enough requirements or if you have too many of them, in this stage it will be helpful using the UML system to express ideas.</p>
    
    <h3>
    Code style:
    </h3>
    <p>In the TDD is also specified the code style, this way is easier for the developers to understand between themselves and the final code is much more clean, for example everyone who codes should  follow the same rules when coding, like:</p>
    - All code should be in english </br>
    - Spacing equally when declaring a function </br>
    - Declaring variables </br>
    - Commenting code </br>
    - Naming </br>
    - Libraries hierarchy </br>

<h3>
     Plataform:
</h3>
<p>The TDD also specifies the main platform the game will be made for, in the case for pc at this moment there are so many different that it will specify the minimum requirements to run.</p>
 <p>For example:</p>

<h3>
     Performance budget:
</h3>
<p>This section of the TDD will be used to describe the goal for the performance of the game running in the desired platform, for example running at least at 60 fps on pc.</p>

<h3>
     Branch workflow:
</h3>
<p> The explanation of all the branches from the project, the importance of each one and a short definition of the reason of its use, for example:</br>
A project with 3 different branches</br>
- Master: A branch only for releases of the game.</br>
- Development: A branch to progress with the game.</br>
- Bugs: A branch for bug fixing. </br>
Something like this:</br>

<h3>Software and hardware needed:</h3>
<p> The TDD will also have a list with all the different software that the team will need and also the hardware for example:</br>

Software: Photoshop, Tiled, Github, 3DS Max, Visual studio.</br>
Hardware: The pcs used and their specifications</br>

<h3>Code reviews:</h3>
<p>Inside the TDD there’s also need to be a dedicated part for the code review, this way it will be much easier for developers to rank any kind of bug, with this bug report template for all the team when someone finds out a bug it will also have to write accurate report about it.</br>

<h3>Code organization overview (UML):</h3>
<p>Inside the TDD there is also one UML that will represent the main structure of the code, there is no problem if this structure has to evolve in the future to adapt to the development process.</br>
