<h2>
     Main core subsystems
</h2>
This game has 3 main core subsystems: </br>
- Entity core: in charge of the management of all the objects in the game (player, enemies with pathfinding, coins and checkpoints). This core controls the addition, elimination, save and load of all entities. All the management can be controlled throught the EntityManager module. Every entity has his own movement, states and physics but they share variables that are located in the Entity module. </br>
- UI core: in charge of the management of all HUD in the game (windows, menus, buttons, sliders, images and texts). This core, like the entity core, can control the addition, elimination of his elements. All the management can be controlled throught the Gui and SceneUI modules. Every UI also have some common variables and are located in the UI_element module. </br>
- Scene core: in charge of the management of the maps and keybinds of the game. All the management can be controlled throught the Scene module. In this module you can control the load and unload of the maps and music. Also, in this module you have all the keybinds functionality. </br>
