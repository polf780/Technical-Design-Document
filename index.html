    <h2>
      What is a Technical Design document?
    </h2>
    
    <p>The Technical Design document is the blueprint that all the engineers on the team will need to understand and use on the process of the creation of a game, the TDD needs to explain not only what will be created it also explains how it will be implemented.</p>
    
    <p>There is a common misunderstanding of what is an TDD, in game development it also exist the GDD (game design document) the definition of both look similar, but the crucial difference is that the TDD it specifies more technically the different parts of the creation of the game and the GDD only describes the game itself and not how it is done. There is also another TDD (test driven development) but this one has nothing to do with the Technical design document.</p>

   <h3>Purpose of the technical design document:</h3>
    <p>Besides the developers of the team the TDD will also be used to explain the game to any publishers our vision and use it as an early milestone to the publisher, the problem that appears with this is that the developers are pressured on the early stages and there is not much time to think the TDD, because the publisher normally prefer seeing something working on the screen, in the stage of the TDD creation is really important because detecting a defect on an early stage like this will save lots of time, energy and money to the team, so the more time expended making a good TDD the less problems we will be facing in the future.</p>

    <h2>
     Which is the moment to make the TDD?
    </h2>
    <p>Normally the TDD needs to be created on the preproduction stage alongside with the document design , during the stage of production there are times when it is necessary to change the TDD , there is nothing wrong on adapting de TDD in response to any change in the game.</p>

    <h3>
     What really goes inside a TDD? 
    </h3>
    <p>The TDD we actually can see it as shopping list of the requirements of the game, which we define whom, when and how this conditions will be achieved, we can see the TDD as a miniature of the project with several stages, in this stages there will be many diagrams and time estimates to complete the different tasks.</p>
    <h3>Requirements Capture:</h3>
    <p>Requirements capture is the part when we identify all the requirements the game has to satisfy, in this process everyone in the team takes part writing down their expectations, and it can be anything from going to 60 fps to having 3d sound and much more like this, but this stage will be the most critical to a successful project and is also the most difficult. It is difficult to know when you have enough requirements or if you have too many of them, in this stage it will be helpful using the UML system to express ideas.</p>

    Special controls:
    </h3>
    - F1: Charge level 1 from the begining </br>
    - F2: Charge level 2 from the begining </br>
    - F3: Charge current level from the begining </br>
    - F5: Save your current position </br>
    - F6: Load your past position </br>
    - F8: Show all UI debug </br>
    - F9: Show all colliders and pathfinding </br>
    - F10: God mode (player without collisions and can fly) </br>
    - F11: Cap frames (siwtch fps cap between 30-60) </br>
    - º: Open console </br>

<h2>
     Innovation:
</h2>
- Enemy states and patrol </br>
- Game pause </br>
- Jump particles</br>
- Coldown on projectiles </br>
- Particle effects </br>
- Checkpoints </br>
- Every 1000 points you gain an extra life (if you get 1000 points (an extra life) and die, </br>
you have to get to 2000 points for another extra life)

<h2>
     Main core subsystems
</h2>
This game has 3 main core subsystems: </br>
- Entity core: in charge of the management of all the objects in the game (player, enemies with pathfinding, coins and checkpoints). This core controls the addition, elimination, save and load of all entities. All the management can be controlled throught the EntityManager module. Every entity has his own movement, states and physics but they share variables that are located in the Entity module. </br>
- UI core: in charge of the management of all HUD in the game (windows, menus, buttons, sliders, images and texts). This core, like the entity core, can control the addition, elimination of his elements. All the management can be controlled throught the Gui and SceneUI modules. Every UI also have some common variables and are located in the UI_element module. </br>
- Scene core: in charge of the management of the maps and keybinds of the game. All the management can be controlled throught the Scene module. In this module you can control the load and unload of the maps and music. Also, in this module you have all the keybinds functionality. </br>
